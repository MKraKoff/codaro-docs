## Enterprise-Grade Security

Your code is your most valuable intellectual property. Codaro is architected with a **security-first mindset**, ensuring that your proprietary data remains private, protected, and under your control at all times.

We operate on a **Zero-Retention** principle regarding your source code.

---

## 🛡️ Zero-Retention & IP Protection

**We do not train our models on your code.**

This is our fundamental promise. Unlike consumer AI tools that may use user data to improve their models, Codaro treats your source code as **ephemeral context**, not training data.

- **Ephemeral Processing:** When our Agentic Engine analyzes a commit, the code is loaded into secure, isolated memory for the duration of the analysis (typically seconds) and is immediately discarded.
- **No Persistence:** We do not write your source files to our database or long-term storage. Only the _insights_ derived from the code (e.g., "Complexity score is 8/10", "Potential SQL injection found") are stored.
- **Isolation:** Your data is logically isolated. Analysis requests are processed in stateless containers that are spun down after execution.

## 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Encryption

Security is natively embedded in every layer of our infrastructure, not bolted on as an afterthought.

- **Encryption at Rest:** All persisted data—including metadata, user profiles, and generated reports—is encrypted using **AES-256** (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmission between your Git provider, your IDE, and Codaro's servers is strictly enforced via **TLS 1.3** (Transport Layer Security). We enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to prevent downgrade attacks.
- **Key Management:** Encryption keys are managed via Google Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) with strict rotation policies.

## 🌍 EU Infrastructure & GDPR

We understand the requirements of European and global enterprises regarding data sovereignty.

- **Data Residency:** Codaro is hosted entirely on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** within the **European Union**. Your data does not leave this jurisdiction.
- **GDPR Compliance:** We are fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation.
  - **Right to Erasure:** You can request the complete deletion of your workspace and all associated metadata.
  - **Data Minimization:** We only request the minimum scopes necessary from GitHub/BitBucket to perform our analysis.
