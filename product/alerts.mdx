## The Smart Alert System

The Smart Alert System is the core of Codaro's "Live GPS" philosophy. Unlike passive dashboards that wait for you to look at them, Smart Alerts proactively push high-signal information to you the moment it happens.

We classify alerts into three categories: **Collaboration**, **Risk**, and **Process**.

---

## 1. Collaboration Alerts

_Preventing friction and merge conflicts before they happen._

### 🤝 Collision Warning (`COLLISION_WARNING`)

The "Air Traffic Control" for your codebase. This alert fires when two developers are heading towards a merge conflict.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - Two or more active editing sessions are detected on the **same file** (or overlapping file paths).
  - Activity must occur within the same **5-minute sliding window**.
- **The Problem Solved:** Merge conflicts waste hours of time and cause regressions. Developers often don't know a teammate is touching the same file until they try to push.
- **The Value:** Immediate coordination. Developers can Slack each other ("Hey, I see you're on `auth.ts`, let's sync") before writing incompatible code.

### 📦 Code Merged (`CODE_MERGED`)

A positive reinforcement loop that keeps the team in sync without status meetings.

- **Trigger Logic:** A Pull Request is successfully merged into the target branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
- **The Value:** Instant awareness. Dependent tasks can be unblocked immediately without waiting for the next stand-up.

## 2. Health & Risk Alerts

_Identifying invisible struggle and technical debt in real-time._

### ⚠️ High Code Churn (`HIGH_CODE_CHURN`)

This is our "Struggle Detection" mechanic. It identifies when a developer is working hard but making little forward progress.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - **Duration:** Session lasts \> **45 minutes**.
  - **Pattern:** High volume of lines changed (Churn) but low Net Progress (final file size change).
  - **Concentration:** Activity is focused on 1-3 "hot files."
- **The Problem Solved:** Developers often spin their wheels on refactoring or complex bugs, afraid to ask for help.
- **The Value:** Empathy and Support. It prompts a manager or lead to check in: _"I see you're wrestling with the payment module. Want to pair on it?"_

### 🔥 Critical Risk Detected (`CRITICAL_RISK_DETECTED`)

An automated quality gate powered by the AI Technical Report.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - Triggered when the **AI Technical Report** analyzes a commit.
  - A specific risk (security vulnerability, breaking change, anti-pattern) is identified with a **Severity Score ≥ 8/10**.
- **The Value:** Safety. Prevents bad code from sitting in the repository unnoticed. It acts as an instant, automated code review for high-severity issues.

## 3. Process & Workflow Alerts

_Automating the "boring" parts of project management._

### 🚀 Task Started (`TASK_STARTED`)

Eliminates the need for manual Jira updates or "I'm starting this now" messages.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - The first **Heartbeat** is detected on a git branch associated with a specific Task ID (e.g., `feature/PROJ-101`).
- **The Value:** Visibility. Everyone knows exactly what is actively being worked on right now.

### 🔄 Task Reopened (`TASK_REOPENED`)

A critical alert for preventing scope creep and zombie tasks.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - Code activity (Heartbeat) is detected on a task that was previously marked as **Done/Completed**.
- **The Problem Solved:** "Zombie tasks" that come back to life often indicate hidden bugs, regressions, or scope creep that wasn't planned.
- **The Value:** Control. Managers can instantly ask: _"Why are we working on the login page again? I thought that was shipped last week."_

### ⏳ Stalled Task (`STALLED_TASK`)

Finds work that has fallen through the cracks.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - A task has a status of **In Progress**.
  - No Git activity (Commits or Heartbeats) has been detected for this task for a configured threshold (default: **48 hours**).
- **The Value:** Flow. Prevents tasks from rotting in the "Doing" column and helps unblock developers who might have context-switched away.

### ✅ Task Completed (`TASK_COMPLETED`)

Closes the loop on value delivery.

- **Trigger Logic:**
  - A task status changes to a completion state (e.g., `Done`, `Deployed`, `Closed`) in the external system (Jira/Linear).
- **The Value:** Celebration and Closure. Confirms that the code has translated into business value.

---

## 4. Smart Summaries

_AI-driven synthesis of complex activities._

### ✅ New Commit (`NEW_COMMIT`)

The "Smart Commit Message."

- **Trigger Logic:** A new commit is pushed.
- **The Value:** Instead of a cryptic message like _"fix bug"_, Codaro's AI generates a clear, human-readable summary of the business impact: _"Fixed null pointer exception in user login flow."_
