## AI Reports: From Diff to Wisdom

Every time code is pushed to your repository, Codaro triggers a chain of AI agents to analyze the work. We don't just look at *lines changed*; we analyze intent, quality, and behavior.

These reports are generated automatically and stored permanently, creating a "living history" of your project's evolution.

## 1. The General Report (The "CEO Translator")
**Audience:** Product Managers, Stakeholders, Non-Technical Leadership.

Most engineering updates are unintelligible to business leaders ("Updated the polymorphic association in the user model"). The General Report translates this technical work into business value.

### How It Works
* **Input:** The raw Git diff + linked Jira task context.
* **The "Translator" Agent:** An AI model instructed to strip out all technical jargon (e.g., refactoring, endpoints, payloads) and focus purely on *user impact*.
* **Output Example:**
    * *Raw Commit:* `feat: refactor auth.service.ts to handle null token payload`
    * *General Report:* "Fixed a critical bug that caused the login page to crash for some users, improving system stability."

### Key Metrics
* **Impact Level:** Low / Medium / High (Is this a trivial tweak or a major release?)
* **Estimated Effort:** Trivial / Moderate / Significant (Did this take 5 minutes or 5 hours?)

## 2. The Technical Report (The "Staff Engineer")
**Audience:** Developers, Tech Leads, QA.

This report acts as an automated, asynchronous code review. It doesn't replace human review but augments it by catching complexity and risks instantly.

### How It Works
* **Input:** The raw Git diff + Static Analysis Metrics.
* **The "Reviewer" Agent:** An AI model adopting the persona of a strict Staff Engineer. It performs a **Proportional Review**:
    * *Low Impact Changes:* Brief sanity check.
    * *High Impact Changes:* Deep analysis of architecture and security.
* **Critical Risk Detection:** If the agent identifies a risk with a severity score ≥ 8/10 (e.g., SQL Injection, Breaking API Change), it triggers a `CRITICAL_RISK_DETECTED` alert immediately.

### Key Metrics
* **Severity Score (0-10):** A quantitative risk assessment.
* **Complexity Delta:** Did this commit make the codebase cleaner or more complex?
* **Code Smells:** Automated detection of anti-patterns (e.g., God Classes, Magic Numbers).

## 3. The Workflow Report (The "Team Mentor")
**Audience:** Engineering Managers, Developers.

This is Codaro's unique capability. We analyze *how* the code was written to understand developer experience and flow.

### How It Works
* **Input:** The Git diff + Real-time Heartbeat data (from the IDE plugin).
* **The "Mentor" Agent:** Reconstructs the work session to answer questions like: *Was this a focused deep-work session, or a fragmented struggle?*

### Key Metrics
* **Flow State %:** The percentage of time spent in deep, uninterrupted work (vs. context switching).
* **Productivity Score:** A synthesis of output volume and focus quality.
* **Context Switches:** How many times the developer had to jump between files or tasks (a high number indicates distraction or poor task definition).

> **Why this matters:** A developer might ship a small PR but have a low productivity score because they were interrupted 15 times. The Workflow Report reveals this hidden cost.
